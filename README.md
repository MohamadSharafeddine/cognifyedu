### CognifyEdu is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React.js framework](https://reactjs.org/) for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- For backend development, the project uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a PHP framework that provides a robust and scalable foundation.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is used for implementing AI and machine learning models, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn.
- The platform leverages [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for deployment, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance of AI applications.
- The project utilizes [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for image processing tasks such as analyzing students' completed test answers and artworks.
- The design of the app adheres to modern UI/UX principles, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience.

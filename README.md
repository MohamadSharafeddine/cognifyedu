<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

### CognifyEdu is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) framework for building the user interface. React is a JavaScript library for creating dynamic, responsive web applications.
- For the backend, the project uses the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) PHP framework, which provides a robust structure for API management, authentication, and database interactions.
- The platform stores data in a [MySQL] (https://www.mysql.com/) database, which is ideal for managing relational data such as student profiles, assignments, and grades.
- To provide AI-driven cognitive and behavioral insights, the platform integrates with the [OpenAI API] (https://openai.com/) for advanced data processing.
- The platform is deployed and hosted on [AWS] (https://aws.amazon.com/) for scalable and secure cloud infrastructure.
